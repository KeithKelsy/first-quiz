As the head of Engineering for this tech startup, I would look for the following security issues in the system based on the OWASP Top 10 for 2021:

1. Injection flaws: I would ensure that all user inputs are properly validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection and other types of injection attacks.

2. Broken authentication and session management: I would ensure that strong password policies are in place, implement multi-factor authentication, and use secure session management techniques to prevent session hijacking.

3. Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks: I would ensure that all user inputs are properly validated and sanitized to prevent XSS attacks.

4. Insecure direct object references: I would ensure that all access to sensitive data is properly authenticated and authorized to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.

5. Security misconfiguration: I would ensure that all components of the system are properly configured and that all unnecessary services and ports are disabled.

6. Insufficient logging and monitoring: I would ensure that all system events are logged and monitored to detect and respond to security incidents.

7. Insecure communication: I would ensure that all communication between components of the system is encrypted and that all APIs are properly authenticated and authorized.

8. Broken access control: I would ensure that all access to sensitive data and functionality is properly authenticated and authorized to prevent unauthorized access.

9. Cryptographic failures: I would ensure that all cryptographic algorithms and protocols used in the system are properly implemented and configured.

10. Server-side request forgery (SSRF): I would ensure that all user inputs are properly validated and sanitized to prevent SSRF attacks.

Based on the roles of the employees, I would also ensure that access controls are properly implemented to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionality.
