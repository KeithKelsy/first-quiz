Using the OWASP Top 10, I would look for the following security issues in my system:

A01: Broken Access Control

I would make sure that only authorized users have access to sensitive data and resources. This includes implementing role-based access control (RBAC) and using least privilege principles. I would also review all of my code for access control vulnerabilities, such as broken authentication and session management.

A02: Cryptographic Failures

I would make sure that all sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit. I would also use strong encryption algorithms and key management practices. I would review my code for cryptographic vulnerabilities, such as weak encryption algorithms and insecure key management.

A03: Injection

I would make sure that all user input is validated and sanitized before it is used in queries or commands. I would also use prepared statements and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. I would review my code for injection vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and command injection.

A04: Insecure Design

I would review my system design for security vulnerabilities. This includes making sure that sensitive data is not stored in plain text, that error messages do not reveal sensitive information, and that all sessions are properly timed out. I would also review my code for insecure design vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

A05: Security Misconfiguration

I would make sure that all of my software and systems are properly configured. This includes applying security patches and updates, disabling unnecessary features, and using strong passwords. I would also review my configuration files for security vulnerabilities.

A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components

I would make sure that all of my software components are up to date and that I am using secure versions of all libraries and frameworks. I would also review my code for outdated and vulnerable components.

A07: Identification and Authentication Failures

I would use strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect user accounts. This includes using two-factor authentication (2FA) and implementing strong password policies. I would also review my code for authentication and authorization vulnerabilities.

A08: Session Management Failures

I would use secure session management practices, such as using HTTP-only and secure cookies and invalidating sessions after a period of inactivity. I would also review my code for session management vulnerabilities.

A09: Insufficient Logging and Monitoring

I would implement logging and monitoring for all critical systems and processes. This would allow me to detect and respond to security incidents quickly. I would also review my logs for suspicious activity.

A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

I would implement measures to prevent SSRF attacks, such as validating all input and restricting access to internal resources. I would also review my code for SSRF vulnerabilities.

In addition to the OWASP Top 10, I would also consider the following security risks specific to my system:

Unauthorized access to solar panels: I would implement measures to prevent unauthorized access to solar panels, such as using physical security measures and requiring users to authenticate before they can access their solar panels.
Data breaches: I would implement measures to protect customer data from breaches, such as encrypting all sensitive data and using strong security practices for the database.
I would also conduct regular security audits of my system to identify and address any security vulnerabilities.

To mitigate the risks to my system, I would take the following steps:

Implement security controls for all components of my system, including the mobile apps, web frontend, database, and backend.
Use a secure development lifecycle (SDL) to develop and maintain my system.
Educate my employees about security best practices.
Monitor my system for security incidents and respond quickly to any incidents that are detected.
By taking these steps, I can help to ensure that my system is secure and that my customers' data is protected.
